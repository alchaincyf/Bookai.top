# 第一份「生成式人工智能证书」来了，附参考答案


## 课程介绍

半个月前，微软和领英合作推出了第一个「生成式人工智能证书」，career-essentials-in-generative-ai-by-microsoft-and-linkedin，这是个免费的有包含生成式AI、人工智能原理、AI伦理等五节内容的免费课程，完成学习并且通过考试后就能得到对应证书了（如题图），可以把证书加到自己的领英页面，也可以写在简历里。

这个证书不能说含金量有多高，但毕竟是业界第一份，而且是微软下场参与认证的，所以我非常建议你可以学习和考一个备着。

注：因为领英目前已经退出了中国国内的运营，所有你会需要一个国际版的领英账号才能参与学习和考试，如果你没有的话，账号注册过程可能会有一定的账号。

## 参考问题&答案

在我视频发出的一个多星期内，我从评论区看到这个考试对普通人而言难度确实有点大，所以为了帮各位考过，我就提供一下我考试时的部分题目和我的答案供参考，实际每个人的考题构成和顺序也许可能会不一样。

1. 问题：Your company produces science fiction and fantasy graphic novels. One of your top illustrators has developed a style that is very strongly associated with your brand. Your company decides to create a generative Al model to mimic their illustrations. This new model can create new graphics in their style in seconds. Now the company will have better control over their brand and increase productivity. What is one of the main challenges with this approach?

- Current generative Al models are not doing a very good job mimicking creative illustrators.

- It is currently illegal in the United States to mimic the style of working illustrators. The generative Al model will always need to be further trained, so it doesn't save any time.

- It will "normalize mediocrity"-the graphics will look the same and lack a creative spark.

答案：It will "normalize mediocrity"-the graphics will look the same and lack a creative spark. ("这将'使平庸变得正常化' - 图形将看起来相同，缺乏创造性的火花")

2. 问题：You recently purchased a new smartwatch. To set up the watch, you had to go to the manufacturer's website and create a new account. When you create an account, it presents a long license agreement you have to accept to create an account. You were anxious to use your new watch, so you didn't scroll through the 50-plus pages of the license agreement. What is one of the ethical issues with how the smartwatch manufacturer is operating?

- It should shorten the license agreement.

- They are not sharing a clear and transparent privacy policy.

- It should have you automatically accept an agreement when you purchase the watch.

- It should always try to keep the private data on the watch itself.

答案：It should always try to keep the private data on the watch itself. (应该始终尝试将私人数据保留在手表本身上。)

3. 问题：What is GAN？

- when two generative Al organizations compete for the same resources

- when two neural networks work cooperatively to produce the best output

24. 问题：Why did early artificial intelligence systems do so well with board games?

- Because board games give the system unique insight into human behavior, early systems could learn and mimic the same behavior.

- Because board games are inherently chaotic, the system had a lot of opportunities to crunch new data.

- Because even with their limiting processing power, early systems thrived in a world of simple rules and pattern matching.

- Because computer scientists could do a good job programming all the rules into the game that the system would understand.
